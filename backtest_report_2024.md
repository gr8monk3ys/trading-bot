## Limitations and Caveats

1. **Slippage Model:** Uses realistic slippage (5 bps base + market impact)
2. **Transaction Costs:** Not explicitly modeled (incorporated in slippage)
3. **Survivorship Bias:** Uses current S&P 500 constituents
4. **Look-ahead Bias:** None - signals generated from historical data only
5. **Data Frequency:** Daily bars only (intraday not tested)

---

## Recommendations

### For Paper Trading Validation
1. Run live paper trading for 30+ days
2. Monitor actual slippage vs modeled slippage
3. Verify signal generation matches backtest

### For Production Deployment
1. Consider position sizing adjustments based on account size
2. Implement proper risk management (circuit breaker enabled)
3. Monitor correlation between held positions
4. Set up alerts for drawdown thresholds
